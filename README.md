code for the paper entitled 'Adaptive dual control with online outlier detection for uncertain systems'

This code enables the functionality of adaptive dual control, which is equipped with an on-line outlier detection mechanism. Our programming aims to address the uncertainty challenges in the control of stochastic systems that is corrupted by noise and outliers. The detailed principles for the derivation of the resulting controller can be found in the paper aforementioned (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019057822000386).
